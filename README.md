# Swainson's Warbler Pressure Analysis

This analysis is part of a multi-state collaboration which deployed multi-sensor geolocators on Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii) in 2021 and recovered tags in 2022. 14 multisensor geolocators recorded light and atmospheric pressure (BARP50Z11-7, Migrate Technology). The [`GeoPressureR`](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/) package will be used to estimate stationary locations from atmospheric pressure and detail migratory flights.

Here we are implementing the [`GeoPressureTemplate`](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate). Files and analysis are built upon the original structure for reproducible purposes.
