This site contains results from barometric geolocator data of Swainson's Warblers (*Limnothlypis swainsonii*). This project involves a collaboration of researchers across the southeastern United States to assess migratory connectivity across breeding populations and characterize their wintering distribution, migratory paths, phenology, and migratory behavior. Barometric geolocators (BARP50Z11-7-DIP, Migrate Technology) were deployed on territorial males in the spring / summer of 2021, and recovered in 2022. Tag data was analyzed implementing the [GeoPressureR](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureManual/index.html) package, which uses weather reanalysis data (ERA5) to match spatio-temporal patterns of atmospheric pressure across the deployment period, as well as altitudinal ranges and a movement model derived from well-defined migratory periods. Our analysis provides accurate and continuous locations throughout each bird's annual cycle, as well as novel flight data.

Each page allows you to explore individual tag data, which can be navigated by breeding region in the top menu bar. For each tag you can find interactive Leaflets and ggplots of the likely and simulated migratory paths, marginal probability heat maps, altitude plots, wind assistance maps, flight histograms, and estimate error histograms. This code workflow and reports are based on the [GeoPressureTemplate](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate).  

## Tag Data

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
# List all the html file found on in the reports/html folder
f <- list.files(path = ".", patter = "*.html", recursive = TRUE)

f_dirname <- lapply(f, dirname)
f_basename <- lapply(f, basename)

for (i_f_dir in unique(f_dirname)) {
  cat(paste("## ", tools::toTitleCase(stringr::str_replace_all(i_f_dir, "_", " "))))
  cat("\n")
  for (i_f in seq_len(length(f))) {
    if (f_dirname[[i_f]] == i_f_dir) {
      cat(paste("* <a href='", f[[i_f]], "'>", sub("\\.html$", "", f_basename[[i_f]]), "</a>"), sep = "\n")
    }
  }
  cat("\n")
}
```
