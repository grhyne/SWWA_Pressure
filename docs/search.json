Multi-sensor geolocators (BARP50Z11-7-DIP, Migrate Technology) were deployed on territorial males in the spring / summer of 2021, and recovered in 2022. Tag data was analyzed implementing the GeoPressureR package GeoPressureR, which uses weather reanalysis data (ERA5) to match spatio-temporal patterns of atmospheric pressure across the deployment period, providing a more accurate approach of geolocation than conventional light-level methods.\r\nSource: Phil StoufferEach page allows you to explore an individual tag, which can be navigated by breeding region in the top menu bar. For each tag you can find interactive Leaflets and ggplots of the likely and simulated migratory paths, marginal probability heat maps, altitude plots, wind assistance maps, and flight histograms. This code workflow and reports are based on the GeoPressureTemplate.GeoPressureTemplate.\r\nTag Data\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# List all the html file found on in the reports/html folder\r\nf <- list.files(path = \".\", patter = \"*.html\", recursive = TRUE)\r\n\r\nf_dirname <- lapply(f, dirname)\r\nf_basename <- lapply(f, basename)\r\n\r\nfor (i_f_dir in unique(f_dirname)) {\r\n  cat(paste(\"## \", tools::toTitleCase(stringr::str_replace_all(i_f_dir, \"_\", \" \"))))\r\n  cat(\"\\n\")\r\n  for (i_f in seq_len(length(f))) {\r\n    if (f_dirname[[i_f]] == i_f_dir) {\r\n      cat(paste(\"* <a href='\", f[[i_f]], \"'>\", sub(\"\\\\.html$\", \"\", f_basename[[i_f]]), \"<\/a>\"), sep = \"\\n\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  cat(\"\\n\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nBasic Trajectory\r\n CB594 \r\n CB596 \r\n CB598 \r\n CB599 \r\n CB601 \r\n CB608 \r\n CB611 \r\n CB616 \r\n CB619 \r\n CB620 \r\n CB621 \r\n CB623 \r\n CB624 \r\n CB627 \r\n\r\nContributors\r\nGarrett Rhyne (Louisiana State University, School of Renewable Natural Resources)\r\nPhilip Stouffer (Louisiana State University, School of Renewable Natural Resources)\r\nThan Boves (Arkansas State University, College of Biological Sciences)\r\nLesley Bulluck (Virginia Commonwealth University, Center for Environmental Studies)\r\nAshley Peele (Virginia Tech, Conservation Management Institute)\r\nDavid Buehler (University of Tennessee Knoxville, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology)\r\nDawson Radar (University of Tennessee Knoxville, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology)\r\nJennifer Tyrrell (Adudubon South Carolina)\r\nMatthew Johnson (Audubon South Carolina)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
